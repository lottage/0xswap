*!*  Need to launch apiKey host server prior to launching 
   shell into '/pages/api/keyvault' 
      -- npm run dev 
   whatever ip/port chosen, update .env.local in /defiswap
*!* Must check to see if keyvault needs to be external of 0xswap for security


Lots of 'localhost' to replace everywhere (so many, double check all the image calls)

cleanup images and references from n2dev

add other 0x supported tokens
